# merge-sort

Two different implementations of the merge-sort algorithm to arrange an array of integer values in ascendng order.

One appraoch utilises recursion, whilst the other approach is based on an iterative solution using both a stack and a queue data structure.
Note that for the recursive solution, python's maximum recursion depth has been increased to allow larger arrays to be sorted.

Both algorithms has a time complexity of O(n log n)
