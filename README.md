# merge-sort

Two different implementations of the merge-sort algorithm to arange an array of values in ascendng order.

One appraoch utilises recursion, whilst the other appraoch is based on an iterative solution using stack and queue data structures.
The iterative appraoch offers the advantage of being able to deal with larger arrays, something python's max recursion depth does not allow in this case.

Both algorithms has a time complexity of O(n log n)
